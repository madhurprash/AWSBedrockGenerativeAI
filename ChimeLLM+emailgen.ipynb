    "### Context\n",
    "Previously we saw that the model told us how to to change the tire, however we had to manually provide it with the relevant data and provide the contex ourselves. We explored the approach to leverage the model availabe under Bedrock and ask questions based on it's knowledge learned during training as well as providing manual context. While that approach works with short documents or single-ton applications, it fails to scale to enterprise level question answering where there could be large enterprise documents which cannot all be fit into the prompt sent to the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern\n",
    "We can improve upon this process by implementing an architecure called Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explain how to approach the pattern of Question Answering to find and leverage the documents to provide answers to the user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- How to manage large document(s) that exceed the token limit\n",
    "- How to find the document(s) relevant to the question being asked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposal\n",
    "To the above challenges, this notebook proposes the following strategy\n",
    "#### Prepare documents\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/Embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n",
    "- Load the documents\n",
    "- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",
    "#### Ask question\n",
    "![Question](./images/Chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the documents index is prepared, you are ready to ask the questions and relevant documents will be fetched based on the question being asked. Following steps will be executed.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved"

    "## Usecase\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "To explain this architecture pattern we are using the documents from IRS. These documents explain topics such as:\n",
    "- Original Issue Discount (OID) Instruments\n",
    "- Reporting Cash Payments of Over $10,000 to IRS\n",
    "- Employer's Tax Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Persona\n",
    "Let's assume a persona of a layman who doesn't have an understanding of how IRS works and if some actions have implications or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will try to answer from the documents in easy language.\n"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude V1 available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: PDF Loader available through LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is the loader that can load the documents from a source, for the sake of this notebook we are loading the sample files from a local path. This could easily be replaced with a loader to load documents from enterprise internal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: FAISS available through LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this notebook we are using this in-memory vector-store to store both the embeddings and the documents. In an enterprise context this could be replaced with a persistent store such as AWS OpenSearch, RDS Postgres with pgVector, ChromaDB, Pinecone or Weaviate.\n",
    "- **Index**: VectorIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "  The index helps to compare the input embedding and the document embeddings to find relevant document\n",
    "- **Wrapper**: wraps index, vector store, embeddings model and the LLM to abstract away the logic from the user."

Also, if you want to control how many relevant documents should be retrieved then change the `k` parameter in the cell below to see different outputs. In many scenarios you might want to know which were the source documents that the LLM used to generate the answer, you can get those documents in the output using `return_source_documents` which returns the documents that are added to the context of the LLM prompt. `RetrievalQA` also allows you to provide a custom [prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/prompts/prompt_templates/getting_started.html) which can be specific to the model.\n",

      "Benefits of AWS Services:\n",
      "Based on the context, some of the relevant AWS services that could benefit the customer include\n",
      "Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Athena. These services can help the customer scale their\n",
      "cloud data platform, boost query performance, and reduce management time. Specifically, Amazon\n",
      "Redshift provides fast query performance on large datasets with its columnar storage and advanced\n",
      "query optimization. Amazon EMR allows running big data frameworks like Spark and Hadoop to process\n",
      "large datasets. Amazon Athena enables serverless queries directly against data in S3 without needing\n",
      "to setup infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost Optimization:\n",
      "To optimize costs, the customer could leverage features like auto scaling in Amazon Redshift to\n",
      "right size clusters based on usage. Amazon EMR can automatically scale clusters up and down based on\n",
      "workload. They could also use spot instances and auto scaling with Amazon EC2 to get compute\n",
      "capacity at the lowest cost. Amazon Athena charges only for the queries run, making it very cost\n",
      "efficient. The customer should enable detailed AWS Cost and Usage reporting to get visibility into\n",
      "spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risk Management:\n",
      "As the customer scales their cloud data platform, they should implement best practices around\n",
      "security, access controls, encryption, data backups, and multi-AZ deployments. Using AWS services\n",
      "manages infrastructure risk, but the customer still needs to monitor for usage spikes, configure\n",
      "budgets, and set billing alerts. A thorough business continuity and disaster recovery plan should be\n",
      "created.\n",
      "\n",
      "AWS Assistance:\n",
      "AWS can help the customer optimize their Redshift and EMR clusters, provide well-architected review\n",
      "of their implementation, deliver hands-on workshops on services like Athena, and supply experienced\n",
      "solutions architects and technical account managers to ensure success. The customer can leverage AWS\n",
