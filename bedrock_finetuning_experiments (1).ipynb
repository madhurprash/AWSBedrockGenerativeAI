    "SageMaker JumpStart provides a variety of pretrained open source and proprietary models such as Llama-2, Anthropic’s Claude and Cohere Command that can be quickly deployed in the Sagemaker environment. In many cases however, these foundation models are not sufficient on their own for production use cases, needing to be adapted to a particular style or new tasks. One way to surface this need is by evaluating the model against a curated ground truth dataset. Once the need to adapt the foundation model is clear, one could leverage a set of techniques to carry that out. A popular approach is to fine-tune the model on a dataset that is tailored to the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge with this approach is that curated ground truth datasets are expensive to create. In this blog post, we address this challenge by augmenting this workflow with a framework for extensible, automated evaluations. We start off with a baseline foundation model from SageMaker JumpStart and evaluate it with TruLens, an open source library for evaluating & tracking LLM apps. Once we identify the need for adaptation, we can leverage fine-tuning in Sagemaker Jumpstart and confirm improvement with TruLens.\n",
    "\n",
    "TruLens evaluations make use of an abstraction of feedback functions. These functions can be implemented in several ways, including BERT-style models, appropriately prompted Large Language Models, and more. TruLens’ integration with AWS Bedrock allows you to easily run evaluations using LLMs available from AWS Bedrock. The reliability of Bedrock’s infrastructure is particularly valuable for use in performing evaluations across development and production.\n"
